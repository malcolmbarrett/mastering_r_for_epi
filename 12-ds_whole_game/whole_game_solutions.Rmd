```

## Playing the whole game

We're now going to put these tools together to import and clean a data set, explore and model the data, and present the results. Our end goal is to create a model that predicts survival in passengers who were on the Titanic. When you're done, knit the results. Try to clean up results so the document works well as a report.

## A few useful tricks to make your report look nice:

* use `knitr::kable()` to render data frames into a nice-looking table. See `?knitr::kable()` for information on rounding digits, column and row names, and more.
* read any messages and warning you get. If you don't think they are important, use `warning = FALSE` and `message = FALSE` in the chunk header. Alternatively, set global chunk options in the `setup` chunk above.
* set your figures to be a higher resolution. You may also want to change their height and width. These are all chunk options (which you can set in each figure-producing chunk individually or globally above). Try `dpi = 300` for resolution. `fig.height` and `fig.width` control height and width (in inches).
* try adding themes to your plots

## Import and clean the data

The Titanic data is in the folder in a Stata file (.dta). Load the data, saving it as `titanic`.

```{r import}
# import the data
titanic <- read_dta("titanic3.dta")
```

Let's look at how many people survived. `survived` and `pclass` are stored as integers, so let's first transform them to factors (see the chapter on factors in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html)). Then, summarize how many people survived and how many died. You can use dplyr to group by survival and then summarize with `n()` or use the `table()` function on `titanic$survived`.

```{r mutate-group-by-summarize}
titanic <- titanic %>%
  mutate(
    survived = factor(survived, labels = c("Died", "Survived")),
    pclass = factor(pclass)
  )

# fill in the code below or use table()
titanic %>%
  group_by(survived) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

Take a look at the names of the columns in `titanic` with the `names()` function.

```{r names}
# look at the names
names(titanic)
```

The `name` variable also contains information on the passenger's title. We're going to use a what are called regular expressions (a way of searching and manipulating strings) to find the title. You don't need to edit that part of the code, but we'll be using a core tidyverse package called stringr to work with it (see the [chapter on strings in R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)). Call the new variable `title`. We'll also clean up a few titles that mean the same thing.

```{r mutate-title}
# pass the data set to `mutate()` and save the results.
titanic <- titanic %>%
  #  take titles from name
  mutate(
    title = str_replace_all(name, "(.*, )|(\\..*)", ""),
    # match abbreviations and French titles to miss and mrs
    title = case_when(
      title %in% c("Mlle", "Ms") ~ "Miss",
      title == "Mme" ~ "Mrs",
      TRUE ~ title
    ),
    # make title a factor
    title = factor(title)
  )
```

Look at how many titles there are. Like above, you can use dplyr or `table()`.

```{r table-title}
# look at the count of titles with dplyr or table
table(titanic$title)
```

There are a lot of unusual and uncommon titles. Since this is a categorical variable, let's collapse those rare ones into a single category called "Other".

1. Mutate the `title` variable and use `fct_lump()` from the forcats package (already loaded) to only keep the top 4 titles. Look at the help page for this function if you don't know how.

Make sure you save the results of `mutate()` to `titanic`.

2. Look at the counts for `title` now.

```{r fct_lump-title}
# collapse uncommon titles into a single category with fct_lump()
titanic <- titanic %>%
  mutate(title = fct_lump(title, 4))

# look at the counts for title again
table(titanic$title)
```

## Missing data

How complete are the data? While we've learned a lot about the passengers on the Titanic since 1912, there are still some things we don't know.

1. Use the `vis_miss()` function from the visdat package on `titanic` to visualize the missing data.

What do you see?

```{r}
# visualize the missing data
vis_miss(titanic)
```

R has many tools for working with missing data. One of the most popular tools for multiple imputation of missing data is the mice package. Let's impute for the `age` and `embarked` variables. We won't be including `body` (the body identification number) in the model, so we don't need to impute it.

The main functions for mice are `mice()`, which imputes the data, and `complete()`, which pools the results.

1. Use dplyr to send the following variables to `mice()`: age, pclass, sex, sibsp, parch, embarked, and title.
2. Save the imputed data as `imputed_titanic`.

We'll save the imputed variables to the data as `mice_age` and `mice_embarked`, but you don't need to change that code.

This chunk can take a while to run. Set the code chunk option `cache = TRUE` for this one. `cache` saves the results so you don't need to keep re-knitting the document.

```{r mice, cache = TRUE}
imputed_titanic <- titanic %>%
  select(age, pclass, sex, sibsp, parch, embarked, title) %>%
  # added the haven::zap_labels because of error
  purrr::map_df(haven::zap_labels) %>%
  mice(method = "norm") %>%
  complete()

titanic$mice_age <- imputed_titanic$age
titanic$mice_embarked <- imputed_titanic$embarked
```

Does imputing age have a big impact on the estimate for its relationship with survival? Survival is a binary variable, so we need a logistic model.

1. Fit the model for the effect of `age` on `survived` and tidy the results.
2. Do the same for `mice_age`.

Are they different?

```{r}
glm(survived ~ age, data = titanic, family = binomial()) %>%
  tidy()

# Do the same for `mice_age`
glm(survived ~ mice_age, data = titanic, family = binomial()) %>%
  tidy()
```

It might also be useful to visualize their distributions.

1. Subset the two age columns
2. Use tidyr to `pivot_longer()` the variable names into one column and the values into another. Since you're only passing two columns, you can tell tidyr to just use everything in the dataset with `cols = everything()`. Name the new columns `"key"` and `"value"` using `names_to` and `values_to`.

3. Color and fill the density plots by the new `key`.

```{r}
titanic %>%
  select(mice_age, age) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "key",
    values_to = "value",
    cols = c(mice_age, age)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, color = key, fill = key)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .7)
```

## Exploratory analysis

There are many ways to go about exploring your data, but let's use a simple one: paired plots. The `ggpairs()` function from the GGally package creates a matrix of plots for all the variables in your data set. `ggpairs()` supports all types of variables (numeric, categorical, etc) and will create the a plot appropriate for the two variables.

1. Subset the survived, mice_age, pclass, sex, and title columns.
2. Pass the results to `ggpairs()`. Color the results by `survived`.

It may take a little bit of time for `ggpairs()` to plot everything.

```{r}
titanic %>%
  select(survived, mice_age, pclass, sex, title) %>%
  # ggpairs doesn't like that the variables are labelled.
  # remove them with haven::zap_labels()
  zap_labels() %>%
  #  color by survival status.
  #  only show age, class, sex, and title.
  ggpairs(mapping = aes(color = survived), columns = 2:5, legend = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  #  put the legend at the bottom
  #  make the column/row text bold
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```

Paired plots contain a lot of information, which is a pro and a con. What do you see?

## Modeling

We'll use a a logistic regression to predict survival. Remember that `survival=1` means survival, so a higher odds ratio means greater odds of survival.

1. Fit a model with survived as the outcome and mice_age, sex, pclass, sibsp, parch, mice_embarked, and title as predictors. Save the model as `survived_model`
2. Tidy the results.
3. Pass the results to `mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, digits = 2))`. These functions take a predicate function (one that produces a `TRUE`/`FALSE` answer). In this case, that's `is.numeric`. Then it applies a function to any variables that result in `TRUE`. Here, we're going to `round` all variables that are numeric to `2` digits.


```{r}
survived_model <- glm(survived ~ mice_age + sex + pclass + sibsp + parch + mice_embarked + title, data = titanic, family = binomial)

survived_model %>%
  tidy() %>%
  #  round all numeric variables to 2 digits
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, digits = 2))
```

What's going on with this model? Something looks wrong. Try to fix it. Hint: when variables on the right hand side of the formula are highly correlated with each other (collinear), it can sometimes mess up the model fit.

1. Save the new model as `survived_model2`
2. Tidy the results and round the numeric variables.

```{r}
#  fit a new model
survived_model2 <- glm(survived ~ mice_age + pclass + sibsp + parch + mice_embarked + title, data = titanic, family = binomial)

#  tidy the results
survived_model2 %>%
  tidy() %>%
  #  round all numeric variables to 2 digits
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, digits = 2))
```

Did your changes work?

## Summarizing the results

Let's save a cleaned up table of the model results. We'll get the estimates and confidence intervals, exponentiation them, and round them.

1. Tidy the results. Get the confidence intervals using the argument `conf.int = TRUE`.

2. Select only the term, estimate, and the upper and lower CIs. To get the confidence intervals, you can enter in the names directly or use dplyr helpers like `starts_with()`.

3. Exponentiate any variable that's numeric. The function for exponentiating is `exp()`. `across()` uses functional programming, though, so we won't include the `()` part of `exp`. (If you're curious about this, look at the next line and how it uses the `round()` function.)

4. Round any variable that's numeric.

```{r}
model_table <- survived_model2 %>%
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  #  filter out the intercept. no need to change this line.
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  select(term, estimate, starts_with("conf")) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), exp)) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, digits = 2))

model_table
```

How do the results look? Let's plot the odds ratios and CIs in a forest plot.

1. Arrange `model_table` by `estimate`.
2. Mutate term to be a factor using `fct_inorder()`. `fct_inorder()` is really useful in plotting because it sets the order of the levels in the factor to be as the first appear in the data. This way, your plot will match your data frame.
3. Set `estimate` to the x-axis and `term` to the y-axis.
4. For the confidence intervals, we need to use `geom_errorbarh()`. We need to tell it where the lines begin and end. Use the variables `conf.low` and `conf.high` for `xmin` and `xmax`, respectively.

```{r}
## Forest Plot
model_table %>%
  arrange(estimate) %>%
  mutate(term = fct_inorder(term)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = term)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high), height = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1)
```

To know the real impact of a single variable on survival, we would need to thoughtfully create a model focused on getting an unbiased effect estimate. Since this is a prediction model, the individual odds ratios may or may not have a have a meaningful interpretation.

Let's look at it from a different perspective: variable importance. In a linear model, variable importance is just the absolute value of the test statistic. The larger the value, the more important the variable to the model.

First, we need to re-tidy `survived_model2` because we got rid of `statistic`. Then, we'll create the variable importance variable and plot it.

1. Tidy the model
2. Arrange the data frame using the absolute value of `statistic`.
3. Create a new variable called `importance` that is defined by `abs(statistic)`
4. Plot `term` on the x-axis and `importance` on the y-axis. (Notice that in the final plot we flipped the coordinates with `coord_flip()`, so actually it ends up the reverse of this!)

```{r}
## Variable importance (abs(statistic))
survived_model2 %>%
  tidy() %>%
  arrange(abs(statistic)) %>%
  # don't plot the intercept value, since it's not a variable
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(
    importance = abs(statistic),
    term = fct_inorder(term)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = term, y = importance)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```
